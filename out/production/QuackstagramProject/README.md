# QuackstagramProject

Welcome to Quackstagram, a Cheapo software solutions social Media App. 

The core of this app revolves around letting users set up and personalize their profiles.
Users sign up, log in, and add a personal touch with photos and bios, just like they
would on Instagram. Once that's done, users can start sharing snapshots of their lives
by uploading images with captions.
